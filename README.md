# Berkelium-project.
- Berkelium project aims to be a brand new blogging platform that federates with servers who uses activityPub protocol. 
- This will be an hobby project for now and I don't have any roadmaps planned yet and now this is just a pile of jsx code that does nothing. But of course things will change when the release 0.2 comes out.
